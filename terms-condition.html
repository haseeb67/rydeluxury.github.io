          <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern the access or use by you, an individual, from within any country in the world (excluding the United States and its territories and possessions and Mainland China) of applications, websites, content, products, and services (the “Services”) made available by Ryde Luxury B.V., a private limited liability company established in the Netherlands, having its offices at Mr. Treublaan 7, 1097 DP, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, registered at the Amsterdam Chamber of Commerce under number 56317441 (“Ryde luxury”).

          <h2>4. Payment</h2>
          <p>You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive from a Third Party Provider (“Charges ”). After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Service, Ryde luxury will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider as such Third Party Provider’s limited payment collection agent. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Ryde luxury. You retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods. Ryde luxury will respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good.
          </p>
          <p>All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by Uber using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which Ryde luxury will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Uber may, as the Third Party Provider’s limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.</p>
          <p>As between you and Ryde luxury, Ryde luxury reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Ryde luxury sole discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. Ryde luxury will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. Ryde luxury may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services or goods from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to such Third Party Provider’s arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee.
          </p>
          <p>This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party Provider for the services or goods provided. Except with respect to taxicab transportation services requested through the Application, Uber does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third Party Provider. Any representation by Ryde luxury (on Ryde luxuryr’s website, in the Application, or in Ryde luxurys marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is “voluntary,” “not required,” and/or “included” in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that Ryde luxury provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Third Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Third Party Provider.</p>
